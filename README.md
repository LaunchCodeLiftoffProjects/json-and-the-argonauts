# Group Gift & Wish List Tracker :gift:

## Group Project: Caleb, Mark, Renee, Sam (LaunchCode Portfolio Project)

### Overview  
Giving gifts is often fun and exciting - but just as often it can get stressful or complicated. Let's say it’s Christmastime again :christmas_tree:, which means it’s gift-giving season. :gift: But you can’t remember what your sister said she wanted this year. Your brother’s text mentioned that your nephews are asking for remote control cars, but which brands or sizes? And you know you told your mom a few things you were interested in, but how will she - let alone everyone else - know or remember what you want? :shrug:  

**If only there was a way to put everyone’s gift wish lists in one place on the web** where you could view other people’s lists, update your own, and even mark gifts on another person’s list as purchased (without that person knowing) so that nobody ends up with duplicates and nobody gets confused.

Well, wait no longer! Our final portfolio project aims to create just such an application. Our Group Gift & List Tracker will make it easy for people to create, update, and manage their own lists of things they’d like to receive as gifts as well as interact with the lists of others in their group. It shares some similarity, for example, to a wedding registry, but with the additional focus on groups and not limited to a specific event. AND it’s marketplace-agnostic, which makes it much more useful since you don’t have to tie yourself to any given retailer.

The inspiration behind this application came from personal experience in trying to keep track of the Christmas gift ideas people often drop in emails, texts, and conversations. We envision, however, that people would find value in using an app like this for birthdays :balloon:, office gift exchanges :people_holding_hands:, graduation giving :woman_student:, or even fundraising :moneybag:. If it involves gift-giving or gift lists :gift:, people could find benefit from using our app.  

### Features :sparkles:
- **User login:** Users will be able to create an account and log in to the application. Each user will have their own separate page. 
- **Authentication levels:** In any given group, there will be 1) admin-level users who can add people to groups and send out group-wide notices and 2) regular users who can do normal things.
- **Create group:** Admin-level users can create a group and invite people to join.
- **Manage gift wish list:** Users can create gift wish lists on their own page and later update them as needed.
- **Interact with other wish lists:** Users can view the wish lists of other people in the group.
- **Mark items as purchased:** Users can mark items on another’s wish list to let everyone else know that it has been purchased. These marks can be seen by everyone *except* the owner of that wish list so that they won’t know what people are getting for them.
- **Communicate with others:** Users can click a button to send an email to another user in the group to ask follow-up questions, e.g. “What size shirt do you wear?”, “You mention earrings, but would other jewelry be okay?”, “Are multiple gift cards okay”?, etc.
